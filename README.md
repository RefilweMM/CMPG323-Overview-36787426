## Branching Strategy

Since I'll be working alone, I'll be utilizing 2 branches namely, main and development. The development branch will be used to make edits to my work and will be pushed to my main branch. The branching strategy will be used for each project

#

## .gitignore File

A gitignore file is essentially used when you don't want to track 'unnecessary' data generated. Therefore I will be using this in all of my projects because I only want to track important and meaningful data

#

## Storage of credentials and sensitive information

It is not recommended to store sensitive information on GitHub, therefore I will be making use of Azure keyvolt and/or use .gitignore file to remove sensitive information on GitHub.

#
## Project Progess
### Project 2 and project 3
I honestly forgot to update my overview README file throughout project completions, therefore I excluded progress documentation for Project 2 and Project 3, and continued for Project 4 and 5.
#
